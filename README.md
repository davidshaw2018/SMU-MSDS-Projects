## Income Classification

Census data was sourced from the [Adult Census Income dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income), in order to classify individuals as earning over \$50,000 annually or not. A variety of techniques was applied to explore the dataset and run our classification tasks. 

[SVMs and Logit](https://github.com/davidshaw2018/SMU-MSDS-Projects/blob/master/Income_Classification/SVMs_and_Logit.ipynb) shows classification results from a Logistic Regression model, as well as from a linear support vector machine classifier. The [classification](https://github.com/davidshaw2018/SMU-MSDS-Projects/blob/master/Income_Classification/Classification.ipynb) notebook details exploration and analysis on a suite of other classifiers for the same task, including a gradient-boosting random forest, a random forest classifier, a MLP neural network classifier, and a K-nearest neighbors classifier.
